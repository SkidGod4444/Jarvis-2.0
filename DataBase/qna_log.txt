Question: If (2x+1) is a factor of 2x +px +qx+r, then find the value of p, q, and r.
Answer: We can use the factor theorem to solve this problem. According to the factor theorem, if (2x+1) is a factor of 2x³+px²+qx+r, then (2x+1) should be a root of the polynomial, which means that if we substitute x=-1/2 in the polynomial, it should be equal to zero.

Let's substitute x=-1/2 in the polynomial:

2(-1/2)³+p(-1/2)²+q(-1/2)+r = 0

Simplifying this equation, we get:

-(1/4)(4p-2q+8r) = 0

Multiplying both sides by -4, we get:

4p - 2q + 8r = 0

This is our first equation.

Now, since (2x+1) is a factor of 2x³+px²+qx+r, we can use long division or synthetic division to find the other factor of the polynomial. Let's use long division:

2x + 1 | 2x³ + px² + qx + r
- (2x³ + x²)
---------------
px² + qx
- (px² + 1/2 q)
---------------
1/2 q + r

Since (2x+1) is a factor of the polynomial, the remainder should be equal to zero. Therefore, we get:

1/2 q + r = 0

This is our second equation.

We have two equations and two unknowns (p and q), so we can solve for them using simultaneous equations.

From equation 2, we get:

r = -1/2 q

Substituting this in equation 1, we get:

4p - 2q + 8(-1/2 q) = 0

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4p - 6q = 0

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

2p - 3q = 0

Multiplying both sides by 2/3, we get:

p = 2/3 q

Substituting this value of p in equation 2, we get:

r = -1/2 q

Therefore, the values of p, q, and r are:

p = 2/3 q

q = any real number (since there are no restrictions on the value of q)

r = -1/2 q

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Question: What is the difference between autotrophic and heterotrophic nutrition? Give examples of each.
Answer: Autotrophic nutrition is a type of nutrition in which an organism produces its own food from simple inorganic substances. Heterotrophic nutrition is a type of nutrition in which an organism depends on other organisms for its food.

Examples of autotrophic organisms include plants, algae, and some bacteria. These organisms are able to produce their own food through photosynthesis or chemosynthesis.

Examples of heterotrophic organisms include animals, fungi, and most bacteria. These organisms cannot produce
Question: What is the structure of DNA? Explain the process of DNA replication.
Answer: The structure of DNA is a double helix. It consists of two strands of nucleotides that are twisted around each other. The process of DNA replication is the process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule is copied to produce two identical copies.
Question: What are the different types of microorganisms? Explain their role in the environment.
Answer: There are four different types of microorganisms: bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa.

Bacteria are single-celled organisms that can live in a wide variety of environments. They play an important role in the environment by breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients.

Viruses are small infectious particles that can cause a wide variety of diseases. They are not considered to be alive, but they can reproduce by infecting other cells.

Fungi are single
Question: What are the different types of reflex actions in humans? Explain the mechanism of reflex actions.
Answer: There are three different types of reflex actions in humans: the patellar reflex, the achilles reflex, and the gag reflex.

The patellar reflex is a reflex action that occurs when the knee is tapped. This action causes the quadriceps muscle to contract, straightening the leg.

The achilles reflex is a reflex action that occurs when the heel is tapped. This action causes the calf muscle to contract, flexing the foot.

Question: What is the difference between a conductor and an insulator? Give examples of each
Answer: A conductor is a material that easily allows electricity to flow through it. An insulator is a material that does not allow electricity to flow through it easily.

Examples of conductors include metals such as copper and silver. Examples of insulators include rubber and plastic.
Question: What are the different types of energy sources? Explain the advantages and disadvantages of each.
Answer: There are four different types of energy sources: fossil fuels, nuclear energy, renewable energy, and hydroelectric energy.

Fossil fuels are a type of energy source that comes from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Fossil fuels are non-renewable, meaning they cannot be replaced once they are used up. They are also a major source of pollution.

Nuclear energy is a type of energy that comes from the nucleus of atoms. Nuclear
Question: Explain the functioning of the human digestive system with the help of a diagram.
Answer: The human digestive system is a long, coiled tube that starts at the mouth and ends at the anus. Along the way, it includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.

The digestive system breaks down food into small pieces that the body can absorb and use for energy. The process of digestion begins in the mouth, where food is chewed and mixed with saliva. Saliva contains enzymes that begin to break down carbohydrates in the food.
Question: What is the difference between an endothermic and exothermic reaction? Give examples of each.
Answer: An endothermic reaction is a type of chemical reaction that absorbs heat from the surroundings. An exothermic reaction is a type of chemical reaction that releases heat to the surroundings.

Examples of endothermic reactions include the melting of ice and the evaporation of water. Examples of exothermic reactions include the burning of fossil fuels and the combustion of explosives.
